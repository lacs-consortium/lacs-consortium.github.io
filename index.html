      The Liberal Arts Computer Science (LACS) Consortium is a group of computer scientists
      who work to model, advance, and sustain the study of computer science in liberal
      arts colleges throughout the nation.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a group, we actively engage in curriculum development, scholarly research,
      and other projects that seek to advance high-quality undergraduate computer
      science education. For more detailed information about our origins, see our <a href='history.html'>History</a> page.
    </p>

    <p>
      Begun in 1984 by 9 computer scientists, LACS soon grew to 18 members, which
      is our approximate size today. To learn more about us and our work, see our
      <a href='who-is-lacs.html'>Who Is LACS</a> and <a href='what-we-do.html'>What We Do</a> pages. To send us feedback or make inquiries about
      upcoming LACS activities, please use the Contact Us page.
